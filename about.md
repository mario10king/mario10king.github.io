### Who am I?

As you probably guessed my name is Mario Marroquin. I was born and raised in Los
Angeles, where I now currently reside.

I try to live my life by taking actions that will help me make the most of this
one guaranteed life we have. This mostly consists of learning, creating, trying
new things and just improving in general.

Some of my favorite things to do are working out and traveling. But my favorite
hobby is soccer. Whether that is coaching, playing, or watching.

### How I got into Programming?

I have had an interest in computers for as long as I can remember.

Some of my first experiences with computers was with computers that my dad would
bring back from work. When the desktops as his work where replaced with newer
ones Since my dad started bringing his old compuytreers from wrok. I would open
them up and unorganize them not alwasy being able to put them bac kt gether .
During HS I knew I enjoyed prgramming and leanreda little bit about html css but
tehre weren't as many resources now.

I deceded to learn this is collefe.I enjoyed my programmign clasees but the
reason i fot into it was to be a ble to create and I just didnt' myself dong
that with what i was learnig.

At this poitn I started learning about bootcamps and I decide to droput and move
across the country. Use all my savings. TRHis is what I wanted.

Since then I've been building full stack web apps.
